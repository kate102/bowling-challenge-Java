# Bowling Challenge Java

## Introduction
I completed this challenge recently in JavaScript. 
I thought it would be a nice idea to use the logic of the kata, which I am now very familar with, to learn a new language.
I decided that I would learn Java, I have completed a small FizzBuzz challenge in Java but I did not TDD it, so I wanted to show that I could TDD a language that I ddn't know, as well as code in it!

## Process
The first thing I had to do was find out how to unit test Java. For that I downloaded junit.


## The first video
This screen recording was from the point at which I got 'Hello World' working and to the end of the gutter game.
